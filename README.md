These examples have been tested on, IBM Cloud and IBM Cloud Pak for Data 4.6, using JupyterLab with Runtime 22.2 on Python 3.10 (recommended to allocate 4GB of RAM and above).

The best way to get started is by running through some examples,

## IBM Cloud Pak for Data as a Service (IBM Cloud)

1. Understanding the basics of the declarative approach - [1-declarative-basics.ipynb](https://github.com/crossdeploy-io/crossdeploy-examples/blob/main/IBM%20Cloud/1-declarative-basics.ipynb)

2. A simple example to store, promote and deploy a model - [2-store-promote-deploy-model.ipynb](https://github.com/crossdeploy-io/crossdeploy-examples/blob/main/IBM%20Cloud/2-store-promote-deploy-model.ipynb)

3. An example on monitoring model focusing on reusability  - [3-monitor-model.ipynb](https://github.com/crossdeploy-io/crossdeploy-examples/blob/main/IBM%20Cloud/3-monitor-model.ipynb)

## IBM Cloud Pak for Data (on-premise)
